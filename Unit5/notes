Embedding other types: 


type sol int
type report struct {
	sol
	location
	temperature
}
Any methods declared on the sol type can be accessed through the sol field or through
the report type:


Name collision^

To prevent name colission of two embeded types
You must manually forward method to the embedded type of your choosing

func (r report) days(s2 sol) int {
	return r.sol.days(s2)
}


Embedding is not inheritance !


Interfaces more concerned on what type can do, not on what value it holds
